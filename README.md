#### What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake


#### How do Deep Learning Networks distinguish between healthy and unhealthy lungs?
Most deep neural network applied to the task of pneumonia diagnosis have been adapted from natural image classification. These models have a large number of parameters as well as high hardware requirements, which makes them prone to overfitting and harder to deploy in mobile settings. Some research on medical image classification by CNN has achieved performances rivaling human experts. For example, CheXNet, a CNN with 121 layers trained on a dataset with more than 100,000 frontal-view chest X-rays (ChestX-ray 14), achieved a better performance than the average performance of four radiologists


1. *DataAnalysis.py files. is for the Exploration of the dataset using several functions like Plots are used as well.

2. *Main.py file is the file for the streamlit connected with the model that was build
3. *x-ray.ipynb. is where all the models where train and build using CNN and VGG16

**** inorder to run the code:
  *install streamlit in your system any version of streamlit will work just 
  *to run it open your command line type "streamlit run and the name of your file
please if you find this useful please start the project
